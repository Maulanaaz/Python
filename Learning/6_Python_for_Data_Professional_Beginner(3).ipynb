    "# WHAT IS OOP ?\n",
    "OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.\n",
    "Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.\n",
    "A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and functions from the class.\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- OOP is faster and easier to execute\n",
    "- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs\n",
    "- OOP helps to keep the Python code DRY \"Don't Repeat Yourself\", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug\n",
    "- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: The \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.\n"
